<h3>Aspect-ratio property</h3>
<div>Hello</div>
<p>The aspect-ratio property is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) property that allows you to define the aspect ratio of an element, such as an image or a container, by specifying the width and height relationship. This property was introduced in CSS4 and is especially useful for responsive web design, where you want to maintain a consistent aspect ratio for elements regardless of screen size or device.

</p>
<p>Aspect-ratio of 3/2 and width set to 100px makes height of red box 2/3 of width in this case.</p>
